## Description
Generate the exercise for today! In this, you will select the number of exercise set you want to do and it will generate the type of exercise and the number in the set of that exercise.

## Technologies
Made using Visual Studio Code, HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Based off of Codecademy's Training Days project but without the marathon and only about daily exercise!

## Usage
From the main page, you will select the number of sets of exercise you want to do (max is 5 as of right now) and it will generate randomly the number of selected exercise and a random number of sets from 1 to 25.

## Contributing
Based off of a Codecademy Project but I have changed it to exercises instead of marathon types of physical activity and I changed it from days into number of sets. Also added HTML and made it useable from outside the console.
